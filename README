Ben - a bookkeeping and accounting system written in Perl 6

This project is named after a real-life Ben, an accountant who saw the
potential benefits of a small computer for a small accounting business
long before such an idea was normal, and before the IBM PC existed.

Ben lacked all understanding of the workings of the machines, and had no
comparable installations to refer to.  Nevertheless Ben committed lots
of time and money through thick and thin to the development of several
very effective computer based accounting systems.  Although those early
systems no longer exist, many ideas flowed from them into this project.
